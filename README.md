### Various Assortment of Files and Scripts

For anything that is done in ANSYS or Matlab, it was due to requirements of the class.
Anything I wanted to calculate for myself was done with either Jupyter Notebook or just Python.

This is the order I took these classes in, as it is not necessarily the typical order:

1) Finite Element Analysis
2) Matrix Structural Analysis
3) AISC Steel Design
4) Structural Dynamics
5) Steel Connection Design
