# Matrix Structural Analysis

For this class I ended up creating a set of files that could automatically choose
the type of structure, Beam, Truss, or Frame, and then complete an analysis using
the Matrix Stiffness Method. Input is provided through excel file.

All files are required for analysis to run. Unfortunately, I attempted to run it using
the current, version of Matlab R2020a, and it didn't run. I have not had time to
find what is failing.
